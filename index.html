		<!-- MAIN CONTENT start -->
		<p>This page will describe what our product is about and when we could fit your needs best.</p>
		
		<h3><a name="what" class="anchor" href="#what"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What?</h3>
		<p>
		SIMBA is an abbreviation of <b>S</b>ecurity <b>I</b>ntegration <b>M</b>odule for <b>B</b>usiness <b>A</b>pplications. It’s a User Access Management (UAM) tool that can be integrated
		 with any business application. Similar to other Access Managers we use an <a href="moreDetails.html#agent-model">agent model</a>.
		An UAM or IAM (identity and access management) system means you have an application that allows easy integration with the users and their roles of your organization. 
		You can configure which user can access which resources based on his roles (authentication and authorization).
		</p>

		<h3><a name="different" class="anchor" href="#different"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why we are different</h3>
		<p>
			In comparison with other UAM tools Simba focusses less on ‘Let’s get something working fast, we’ll define a user and password in a plain text file and worry about the rest later. 
			We just need to make sure users can login now’... 
			Simba tries to focus on and bring together 3 important aspects: <strong>Security best practices, performance and user maintainability</strong>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SIMBA_Project"><img alt="OWASP" src="images/owasp.jpg"></a>
			We try to offer a good set of security features based on OWASP recommendations and we also know that developing a security solution is less work compared to having to manage 
			the users and roles once the system is in production for the next 10 years. However if an OWASP recommendation is making a certain process horribly slow, a weakened version of 
			the feature is implemented to keep your application performant.<br>
			Projects like apache Shiro are definitely a more powerful and mature product to integrate with technologies such as Stormpath, grails, OAuth, … . And they contain more powerful features in fields as cryptography. More info can be found here http://shiro.apache.org
			They do not provide DB schemes to get started quickly or a GUI to manage the users. They also leave it up to your project whether or not to implement OWASP guidelines.
